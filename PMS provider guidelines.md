2. PMS providers should display the Statistics disclaimer (front of existing form, Purpose, Compulsory, Confidentiality section) when asking for consent.
3. Accommodation survey data must be submitted monthly for the previous month. The data should be sent as early as possible at the start of the following month. PMS providers may display a reminder to their customers if the data is not submitted automatically.

5. The PMS provider may arrange with their customers for the data to be submitted automatically each month.
